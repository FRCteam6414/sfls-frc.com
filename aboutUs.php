                By the end of 2013, two juniors had known FTC and decided to organize teams to participate in 2014 season. Being unfamiliar with each other, they founded SFLS Robotic Club and SFLS Association for Science and Exploring and started to work on the plan for competition separately. Under the condition of lacking money and support from professionals, these FTC team members self-studied two different structural systems—Tetrix and Matrix—and LEGO NXT programming based on Labview. Through a lot of effort, the two teams joined in the South-China Regional in 2014. SFLS Robotic Club, as a rookie team, harvested Connect Award and was selected to the National Final. Fortunately, after participating in the competition in 2014, the two FTC teams decided to work together for some reason. They helped each other with materials and technology as well as prepared for 2015 season confidently with new members from senior one. Where there is a will, there is a way. SFLS Association for Science and Exploring won the Think Award and made it to the National Final. In the summer of 2015, the two founders graduated from high school. The new junior team leaders took part in the establishment of SFLS Qihang Makerspace and formed strong ties with other technological clubs of the school. What's more, the two teams built up the relationship between Shenzhen Chaihuo Makerspace and received technological support by them. Benefited from these helps, in 2016 FTC, the two teams achieved excellent results. SFLS Robotic Club obtained the Motivate Award in Shenzhen Regional, the Second Prize in Chongqing Regional, the PTC Design Award, and received an invitation to World Championship in Australia held by Macquarie University. SFLS Association for Science and Exploring won the Think Award in Shenzhen Regional, the Third Prize in Chongqing Regional and the Second Prize in National Final.

                We are Voyager #6414, the Shenzhen Foreign Languages School FIRST Robotics team. Our goal is to inspire young people to fully appreciate the robotic world and dream of becoming the science and technology leaders in the pursuit of STEM. We also strive to contribute the understanding of teamwork and “Gracious Professionalism”, as well as helping students,  develop interests for their future. We are intent to inspire these Non-SFLS students to experience this impressive challenging process and encourage them to found their own school’s FRC team in the future by spreading the FIRST message to promote the students who learn the robotics and STEM in general.
